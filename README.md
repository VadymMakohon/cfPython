# cfPython_Achivement1

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a command-line version of a Recipe app, which will serve as a precursor to its web app counterpart. This project focuses on learning Python fundamentals, data structures, object-oriented programming, and database interaction using Python.

## Context
Building a website with the Django web framework is primarily done in Python, leveraging its object-oriented nature. This project will help you understand Python programming, data structures, and OOP principles, which are crucial for working with Django. Additionally, you'll learn how to interact with databases using Python, making it easier when working with Django. This project emphasizes standard programming practices to make your code simple, readable, and robust.

## Project Deliverables

Throughout this project, you will complete several exercises, each contributing to the final product: a Recipe app that stores and searches for recipes.

### Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use pip to install and manage packages
  
### Exercise 2: Data Types in Python
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes with their internal data
- Enter multiple recipes into a linear data structure

### Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
- Create your first script in a .py file
- Build a script that uses if-elif-else statements, for loops, and functions to take recipes from the user and display them

### Exercise 4: File Handling in Python
- Create a Python script that takes recipes from the user and writes the data in a binary file
- Create another script that reads the binary file and lists available ingredients. The user chooses an ingredient, and the script displays all recipes containing it
- Use Pythonâ€™s exception handling features to handle common errors

### Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Build a custom class for your recipes, containing data attributes for name, ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, as well as custom methods to interact with this data

### Exercise 6: Connecting to Databases in Python
- Set up a MySQL database and connect your scripts to it
- Build an application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes recipes, and searches for them by a single ingredient

### Exercise 7: Finalizing Your Python Program
- Use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) from SQLAlchemy to manage the contents of your database from your application
- Build a user-friendly menu for entering and searching recipes and ingredients
- Store recipe and ingredient data in a MySQL database
- Implement recipe search according to user-defined ingredients
- Implement a detailed display of the recipe selected by the user
